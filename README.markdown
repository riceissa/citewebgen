# Citewebgen

Citewebgen is a [Cite web][cw] generator. It is a single JavaScript file that
can be installed as a bookmarklet on a browser.

## Features

- Detection of all common fields
- Support for the `quote` field if text is selected on the page
- Date reported in UTC
- Works on all browsers supporting JavaScript

## Installation

You can install the script by copying the contents of the [minified
script][mini] into a bookmark.

## Examples

on Firefox:

Chrome:

## Caveats

On Firefox, some websites (e.g. GitHub and Twitter) block bookmarklets from
executing. If you have the developer console open while trying to run the
script, you will see the following message:

> Content Security Policy: The pageâ€™s settings blocked the loading of a
> resource at self

I'm not sure how to fix this on Firefox, but one workaround is to open the same
page on Chrome and run Citewebgen there.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Ark25 for creating and hosting [RefScript][rs]. I referred to
the source of RefScript while working on Citewebgen. Both scripts are in the
public domain.
