Citewebgen is a [Cite web][cw] generator. It is a single JavaScript file that
can be installed as a bookmarklet on a browser.

## Features

## Installation

You can install the script by copying the contents of the [minified

Special thanks to Ark25 for creating and hosting [RefScript][rs]. I referred to
the source of RefScript while working on Citewebgen. Both scripts are in the
public domain.
